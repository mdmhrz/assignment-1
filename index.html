                <p class="quote-p">"I'm doing this because this is what the youth of the country wanted, and I wanted to help them to do it. It's not my dream, it’s their dream. So I'm kind of helping them to make it come true. Law and order is the first one so that people can sit down or get to work. Even the government, what they did, whatever they did, just simply doesn't make sense to me. They didn't have any idea what administration is all about. We are here: a fresh new face for them, for the country. Because finally, this moment, the monster is gone. So this is excitement."</p>
